# Supply-Chain-Analytics
Power BI project
This project focused on developing a powerful make-versus-buy analysis tool using Power BI. A quote analysis tool was created, production costs were calculated for various volumes, and internal manufacturing cost data was integrated for in-depth analysis. The project highlights the advantages of using Power BI over traditional spreadsheets, offering a flexible and scalable model that can be extended to include additional cost factors and supply chain considerations.
